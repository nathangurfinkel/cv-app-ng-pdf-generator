# Systematic workflow (SOLID + quality bar)

## Before changing code

- **Clarify the goal**: restate what “done” means and what must NOT change (API contracts, templates, infra).
- **Plan with SOLID in mind**:
  - Single Responsibility: avoid “god” services/files.
  - Dependency Inversion: depend on small interfaces (e.g., storage/renderer abstractions), not concrete libraries.
- **Search first**: extend existing patterns before adding new ones.
- **Cross-repo awareness**: if you change an API contract, update the consumer repo(s) in the same PR/plan.

## While implementing

- **Keep boundaries clean**:
  - Routes/controllers: request/response validation + orchestration only.
  - Services: business logic.
  - Utils: pure helpers.
- **Be explicit about security**: validate external inputs; never trust URLs, file paths, or HTML.
- **Avoid new dependencies** unless there’s clear ROI and no simpler option.

## Done criteria

- **No PII/secrets in logs** (log sizes/ids, not raw CV content).
- **Basic checks pass** (type/lint/tests available in the repo).
- **Docs updated** when behavior/config/contracts change (README/env examples).
